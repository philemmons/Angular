Prerequisites

If you want to follow this tutorial, you’ll need to have:

    Prior knowledge of TypeScript.
    
    A development machine with  Node 8.9+ and  NPM 5.5.1+  installed. Node is required by the Angular CLI. You can head to the official website and grab the binaries for your system. You can also use  NVM  — Node Version Manager — a POSIX-compliant bash script to install and manage multiple Node.js versions in your machine.

If you are ready, let’s learn by example how to build an Angular 8 application that consumes a REST API using HttpClient. We'll implement real-world features like error handling and retrying failed HTTP requests.

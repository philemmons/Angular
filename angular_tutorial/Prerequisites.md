# Assumptions

- A development machine with  Node 8.9+ and  NPM 5.5.1+ installed. 
- Node is required by the Angular CLI. You can head to the official website and<br> grab the binaries for your system. 
- You can also use  NVM  — Node Version Manager, a POSIX-compliant bash script<br> to install and manage multiple Node.js versions in your machine.
- Please read the ISSUES.md file to avoid pitfalls and variations.
- Let’s learn by example how to build an Angular 8 application<br> that consumes a REST API using HttpClient. We'll implement real-world <br>features like error handling and retrying failed HTTP requests.

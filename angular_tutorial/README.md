### Assumptions
>These docs assume that you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
<br/>and some of the tools from the latest standards, such as classes and modules. 
<br/>The code samples are written using TypeScript. Most Angular code can be 
<br/>written with just the latest JavaScript, using types for dependency 
<br/>injection, and using decorators for metadata.

### Here are a few things we'll learn:

 - How to mock a REST API server that uses fake data from a JSON file.
 - How to consume the REST API from our Angular 8 application using  Httplient.
 - How to handle HTTP errors using the RxJS  throwError()  and  catchError()  operators.
 - How to retry failed HTTP requests in poor network conditions and cancel pending<br/>requests using the RxJS  retry()  and  takeUntil() operators.
 - How to create and make use of Angular components and services.
 - How to set up routing and Angular Material in our project and create a <br/> professional-looking UI with Material Design components.
 - And finally, we’ll learn how to deploy the application to Firebase <br/>using the 'ng deploy' command available in Angular 8.3+.

### You’ll also learn by example:

 - How to quickly mock a REST API with real-world features, such as pagination, <br/>that you can consume from your app before you can switch to a real <br/>backend when it’s ready.
 - How to set up Angular CLI.
 - How to initialize your Angular 8 project.
 - How to set up Angular Material.
 - How to add Angular components and routing.
 - How to generate and use Angular services.
 - How to consume REST APIs with Angular HttpClient.
 - How to build and deploy your Angular application to Firebase.
